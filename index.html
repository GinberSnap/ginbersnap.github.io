                    <p>Instructional design that considers ethical implications creates an inclusive environment and helps reach diverse learners.</p>
                
                    <p>Some key ethical principles include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Accessibility and Inclusivity</strong> - Provide tools, such as alternative text, closed captions and accessible navigation to make learning materials accessible for all students</li>
                        <li><strong>Transparency</strong> - Providing accurate information helps build user trust and confidence</li>
                        <li><strong>Professional Integrity</strong> - Upholding professional integrity ensures high quality learning materials and meet educational
                        standards.</li>
                    </ul>
                
                    <p><strong>Privacy and Data Security: </strong> <br>
                    When considering ethical instructional design, it is critical to protect students' privacy and personal data. eLearning providers are legally obligated to comply with privacy laws and regulations such as the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA). Many websites and online platforms use applications that track user activities and build databases, often doing so in the background without the userâ€™s knowledge or consent. On January 28, 2022, a vulnerability found in Illuminate Education's software led to a data breach, exposing approximately 820,000 New York City public school students' personal information (NYC Public Schools, n.d.). FERPA was established in 1974 and designed to protect students' personal information from disclosure to third parties without parental consent and to prevent similar data breaches (SPLC,n.d.). </p>
                
                    <p><strong>Diversity: </strong> <br>
                    It is also important to take economic factors into consideration when designing eLearning courses. According to a study, more than ten million US residents lacked access to high-speed internet in 2021 (USA Facts, 2022). Requiring large file downloads or interactive applications that consume significant bandwidth creates barriers and limits accessibility for many students.</p>

                    <p>Learning ethical hacking requires high-speed internet and significant resources. My goal is to address ethical and inclusive issues, including economical factors. I hope to develop a course focused on practical skills that students can learn without relying on fast internet or advanced technology. </p>
